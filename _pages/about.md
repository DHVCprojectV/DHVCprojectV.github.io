Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the George Washington University (GWU) doing my research
under supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mona-diab-55946614/">Dr. Mona Diab</a>
and <a href="https://www.seas.gwu.edu/david-broniatowski">Dr. David Broniatowski</a>.

My main areas of interest are Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
. My current research focuses on providing an analytical framework for understanding how individuals make various
decisions on social media, including spread of mis/disinformation. I am also interested in Commonsense Reasoning and
Story Understanding in natural language. I work on developing NLP models to extract causal relations, explicit or
implicit, in discourse. My goal is to leverage these models in enabling machines to better understand stories and find
causal chains among events in a story.
